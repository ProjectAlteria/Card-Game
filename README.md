## An indie/student project developing a card game closely based on the 'Battleship' board game. 
## Rules: 
1. The game is set on a 4 by 4 grid opening up a sample space of 16 possible positions.
2. Cards are used as the main mechanic to interact with the grid.
3. The two types of cards are decision cards and character cards.
4. The decision cards allow the player to place a bet on where the opponent ship might be on the opponent board.
5. The character cards allow the player to place their own arrangement of ships on their side of the board.
6. There are 16 decision cards in total (representing the 16 unique locations on the board) but the player is only dealt a hand of 7 cards.
7. There are 4 character cards that are present for every playthrough for the player to place on their respective grid.
8. When the game starts, the player has to guess where the opponent ships may be on the grid using the decision cards.
9. The points gained are based on the type of card found by the player.
10. The game continues until the player and the opponent (the computer) have used up their 5 decision cards.
11. The game ends and the total number of points collected by each is counted.
12. The one with the highest number wins.
13. Let the battle begin! 

## Main Inspiration 
The image attached below is our main inspiration and model for the card game called 'Sea Battle'. It is available online at: https://cardgames.io/seabattle/ 
We have decided to use the model's two screen framwork for the player and the computer and the grid-based system (though ours is smaller). Our main mechanic is moving the cards on the board and cards only occupying single spaces on the grid as opposed to multiple as reflected in image below.
